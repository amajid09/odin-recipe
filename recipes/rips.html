    <h1>Slow cooker Baby Back Ribs</h1>
    <p>These slow cooker ribs are the best I've had, short of the actual grilling method of course! They're easy to make by just cooking them in the slow cooker until tender, covering them with barbeque sauce, and finishing them off in the oven. This is what I do when I want ribs during the week — I'm eating them within 30 minutes of getting home, and they turn out perfect every time!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Ribs: </b> For about six servings, you'll need three pounds of trimmed baby back ribs. </li>
        <li><b>seasoning: </b> The ribs are simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Water: </b>You will need about ½ cup of water.</li>
        <li><b>Onion</b> and <b>garlic: </b>Sliced onion and minced garlic lend bold flaver.</li>
